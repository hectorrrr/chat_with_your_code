## Project Description

This repository is meant to develop a tool to chat with you own code. Beyond this, the goal is to leverage RAG methods to both help to build a centralized code repository, with reusable and personalized high quality code, and improve regular Chatbots for coding purposes (ChatGPT...) with more customized functionalities. Since the emergence of LLMs, AI development has accelerated significantly. On the other hand, the quality of the code provided by LLMs is often decontextualised, or does not follow our own standards. So, once a 'good implementation' has been retrieved or generated by us, it would be more efective to use it as a starting point for future occasions.

For this implementation we will using (initially), LangChain, and we will use the development to test the different functionalities, and work on the different key points of these architectures, although those tests will be stored in parallel repositories.

To further ilustrate the vision of this project we add to this repository a 'code' folder, over the one we will create a 'Knowledge graph' using 'Neo4j' with this purpose.


## Installation

Install Python (version 3.10 was used for this development).

Open a terminal in the desired directory and run:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv <your_env_name>
```

Windows:
```bash
./<your_env_name>/Scripts/activate
```

Linux:
```bash
./<your_env_name>/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Install the desktop version of [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop-manual/current/installation/download-installation/).

Once all previous steps are completed, create a .env file with the following variables:

OPENAI_API_KEY=<>

NEO_4J_password=<>





## Usage

Once we have everything set up, the first step would be to generate the knowledge graph from our data, this is completely customizable and is done with a manual/fixed logic, based in personal needs. Also this step will be in continuous improvement. You can find this development, as well as the current logic in [Graph Generation](src\utils\populate_KT_with_code.ipynb). Customize and run those cells to get your own Knowledge graph. This will be automized in next steps.
