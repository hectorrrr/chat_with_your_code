# Chat with your code
This repositovy is meant to develop a tool to chat with you own code. Beyond this, the goal is to leverage RAG methods to both help to build a centralized code repository, with reusable and personalized high quality code, and improve regular Chatbots for coding purposes (ChatGPT...) with more customized functionalities. Since the emergence of LLMs, AI development has accelerated significantly. On the other hand, the quality of the code provided by LLMs is often decontextualised, or does not follow our standards. So, once a 'good implementation' has been retrieved or generated by us, it would be more efective to use it as a starting point for future occasions.

For this implementation we will using (initially), LangChain, aand we will use the development to test the different functionalities, and work on the different key points of these architectures, although the tests will be stored in parallel repositories.


## Installation

Install Python (version 3.10 was used for this development).

Open a terminal in the desired directory and run:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv <your_env_name>
```

Windows:
